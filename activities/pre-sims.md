# Pre-Sims Activities

These are activities that happen before the commencement of `Simulations`.

* Get report on fellows from `M1` (and `Boot Camp`?)
* Meet with fellows
    * Introduction
        * Each person shares
            * Background
            * Experience
            * Goal

        * What I think of when rating fellows
            * Feedback will always be shared
            * Ratings don't depend on feedback but my confidence in a fellow
            * Confidence is dependent on `context + feedback`
    * Go through all LMS outputs to set expectations.
